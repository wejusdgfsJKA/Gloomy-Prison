# Code conventions

## Variable naming (includes properties)

Exposed variables: uppercase

Protected/private variables: camelcase

Local variables: lowercase

## Trunk based development

 * Prefer many small commits and small PRs
 * Develop in short-lived branches
 * High emphasis on fast continuous integration
 * High turnaround time on PR reviews

Strive for branches that live a few hours or a day instead of weeks to prevent large merges.
